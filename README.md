## What are the different shale gas basins in the WFEC territory?
1. Go check this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Shale_gas_plays,_May_2011.pdf
- The main shale basins are:
- Anadarko basin
- Ardmore basin
- Arkoma basin
- Cherokee Platform
They are grouped as the WoodFord Shale



## When did the shale revolution start in the USA?
- In the US it really started around 2006.
- For the WFEC territory, that is mostly dominated by Okhlaoma and 
the WoodFord Shale region, we witnessed a huge increase in oil
production between 2011 and 2014. Oil production increased 74% 
from 2011-2014 to 128 million bbl, 
rising by nearly 300,000 b/d, 
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
- Even with the rig count steadily in decline during 2015, 
Oklahoma still had surpassed its 2011 
oil production by July 2015 with 73 million bbl
- Over the 2011-2014 period, the number of drilling rig substantially
increased too
